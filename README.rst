Introduction
------------
cpuid is a C++ library for CPU dispatching functionality testing.

License
-------
cpuid license is based on the BSD License. Please refer to LICENSE.rst file
for more details.

Platforms
---------
We have tested cpuid on various versions of Windows, Linux and Mac. Also, we
have tested it in x86 and ARM architectures with different compilers like GCC,
Microsoft Visual Studio, CLang and LLVM. You can see the status by selecting
the cpuid project on the Steinwurf
`buildbot page <http://176.28.49.184:12344/>`_:

Build
-----
We use the ``waf`` build-system to build the cpuid static library.
With some additional tools which may be found at external-waf_

.. _external-waf: https://github.com/steinwurf/external-waf

To build cpuid run the following command:
::
  ./waf configure --bundle=ALL --bundle-path=~/dev/bundle_dependencies
  ./waf build

Substitute the ``~/dev/bundle_dependencies`` with the path where you wish
waf to download cpuid's dependencies. You should now have the ``libcpuid.a``
static lib. In the cpuid directory type ``find . -type f -name "*.a"`` to see
the libraries produced.

When building the static lib, waf will also build the ``print_cpuinfo_example``
executable in the ``~/dev/cpuid/build/linux/examples/print_cpuinfo``
path. You may check with this example your local instruction sets

We have created cpuid to fit our specific purpose, however we hope
that others may also find it useful. When designing cpuid we found
inspiration in these other nice projects:

* CPUID website on Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPUID
* zchotia's gist: https://gist.github.com/zchothia/3078968
* Facebook CPU ID implementation: https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/master/folly/CpuId.h
* ARM Cortex-A Programmer's guide

Thanks in advance
